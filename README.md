# Computational_Intelligence

This repo is for a computation intelligence course where a particle swarm optimization algorithm is implemented for finding roots of a polynomial of degree 2, 3, 4 and other higher degree.
part_b.m implements PSO varient Lbest for quadratic equation. and part_c.m extends the logic of part_b for higher degrees such as 3,4,5 and so on.
